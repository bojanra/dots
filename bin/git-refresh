# This enables you to pull changes from a different remote branch to your local branch with just one command. You can
# write your own custom git commands to do whatever repetitive actions you do multiple times a day. For, me I usually
# update my local branch with the remote branch from which I branched off initially. Doing this would usually take
# multiple commands.
#
# Regardless of the branch you are on, this code:
# - stashes changes (if any)
# - checks out master
# - Do a fast-forward merge
# - checks out your branch (if it's not master)
# - rebases onto master (if branch is not master)
# - pops changes from stash, if any
#
